To protect customers' privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), I was a back-end software engineer on the team that developed Capital One's CCPA data fulfillment pipeline. This system empowers the firm's ~100 million customers to request their data be downloaded or deleted, giving them more control over their personal information.
